I'm not planning on leaving Twitter anytime soon, but I'm always on the lookout for exciting new social networks. Lately, I've been checking out this awesome social platform called [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), and it's like Twitter, but with a twist - it's open source and decentralized, which is pretty cool.

Anyway, while I've been exploring Bluesky, I've been actively looking for PHP developers. So, I thought I'd share with you a list of PHP developers that I've come across on Bluesky so far:
